        <p class="mt-4">This is a demo "SPA" made with MirageJS and Vue 3.
        It serves as an example used in the <a class="underline" href="https://css-tricks.com/dont-wait-mock-the-api/">article</a> I have written for CSS-Tricks.</p>

        <p class="mt-4">It has two tabs to demonstrate how Mirage's database can
        persist data during a single application session.</p>

        <p class="mt-4"><em>Note that Mirage's state will reset when we reload the application.</em></p>
